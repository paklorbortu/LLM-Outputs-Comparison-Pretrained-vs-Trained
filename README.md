Comparion of outputs of a pre-trained Large Language Model with a trained Large Language Model under an IT domain.
This repository contains files and screenshots of the outputs of pre-trained and trained Llama2 model. The comparison focuses on the text generation capabilities, domain knowledge and concision of the models. 

**Below are the steps for taken for this project**. 

Pre-trained Model Evaluation
--Deploy the Llama2 model on AWS Sagemaker.
--Evaluate the pre-trained Llama2 text generation Large Language Model for IT domain knowledge.
Fine-tuning the Large Language Model
--Fine-tune the Large Language Model with IT domain dataset.
Evaluate the fine-tuned Llama2 Large Language Model
--Deploy the fine-tuned Llama2 Model on AWS Sagemaker.
--Evaluate the fine-tuned Llama2 text generation Large Language Model on text generation tasks and domain knowledge.
